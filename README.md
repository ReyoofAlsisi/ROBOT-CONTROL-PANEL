ROBOT CONTROL PANEL

Introduction:
This project is focusing on creating a control panel for robot movement using PHP, Visual Studio, XAMPP, and phpMyAdmin. The control panel is enabling five main movements for 
the robot: forward, backward, right, left, and stop. This guide is walking you through the steps of setting up the environment, developing the control panel, and configuring the 
necessary database tables.

Prerequisites: 
1\ Visual Studio: An integrated development environment (IDE) for coding 
2\ XAMPP: A software package providing Apache, MySQL, and PHP 
3\ phpMyAdmin: A web-based database management tool included with XAMPP

Setup Steps: 
1\ Installing XAMPP 
2\ Downloading XAMPP and launching the control panel 
3\ Starting the Apache and MySQL services. 
4\ Setting Up phpMyAdmin 
5\ Accessing phpMyAdmin by opening a web browser and going to http://localhost/phpmyadmin. 
6\ Creating the Database: 
    - Clicking on the "Databases" tab.
    - Entering a name for your database (e.g., robot_control) and clicking "Create". 
    - Creating the Table 
    - Selecting your newly created database. 
7\ Clicking on the "SQL" tab and executing the following SQL query to create a table for storing control commands

Conclusion: 
You are currently setting up a basic control panel for robot movement using PHP, XAMPP, and phpMyAdmin. This setup is allowing you to send movement commands to a robot via a web interface and store these commands in a MySQL database. You can continue enhancing this project by adding authentication, improving the user interface, or integrating it with a real robot control system.
